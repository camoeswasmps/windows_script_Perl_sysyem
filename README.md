# windows_script_Perl_sysyem
This will be the windows version of the unix script "check my system status" will take care of the cpu usuage along with the most demanding process, RAM usage , memory status , etc.


The focus on this will be how perl interacts on a non Unix based system, since perl has his roots on such operative systems. I will be using the last version of active perl along some CPAN modules which i will indicating on the go.

The cool part would be also implementing a "wanna be cron" who will launch this script at certain times of the night (in order to not interfeer with the user experience ) this is aimed for servers, but can also be used for common user as long as he has the appropiate modules activated and installed, as well as the Perl intalled on his system.

Also , depending of how lazy i feel , will try to implement de Statistics::R module in order to interact with the R software so i will not have to work with raw data and get some cool dyagrams  and all that, i'm still not entirely sure about this section. Jesus i will need to "un-do" this readme , it's all messy.

I'm just trying to avoid all the "schedule tasks" that windows provide since  this is pure trainning experience.
